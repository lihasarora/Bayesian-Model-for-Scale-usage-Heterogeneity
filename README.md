# Bayesian Model for Survey Data Heterogeneity
 Ratings data is often biased in a market research survey. If not corrected properly, It can lead to false inferences for covariance based methods such as regression. In this project, I develop a Bayesian model to tackle the survey data heterogeneity. Upon model implementation, I show how does accounting for survey data heterogeneity changes inferences about people with extreme view and correlation among different responses

The two main insights were as follows:
1. Elimination of spurious correlations
2.  I demonstrated that when adjusted for Survey Usage Heterogeneity, the questions that probe about different aspects of a product in survey should don't have high correlation, leading to better inferences
3.  Below is the snapshot of the slide that showcases this in detail
